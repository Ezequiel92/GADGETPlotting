Julia script for creating plots, GIFs and videos from the data produce by GAGET2/3/4 simulations.

- It only works with the traditional output format (binary data) which is the default in GADGET2/3 (`SnapFormat = 1`) and a compatibility option in GADGET4 (`SnapFormat = 1`).
- It is a script inside a module, not a package. Only five global constants and no data structures are defined.
- A small testing data set is provided in `example/test_data/`.
- The script `example/example.jl` shows how to import the script, gives examples for every function, and provides a sanity check, as it should run without errors.
- The dependencies are given by the `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files.

## Functions

There are four tiers of functions:

- Auxiliary functions (`src/auxiliary.jl`): These are only for internal use. They do soma data processing.
- Data acquisition functions (`src/data_acquisition.jl`): These are only for internal use. They take the raw data, apply some transformation (e.g. units) and return it as a familiar data structure.
- Plotting functions (`src/plotting.jl`): These are exported. They take data in the format returned by the data acquisition functions and return plot objects.
- Pipeline functions (`src/pipelines.jl`): These are exported. They take the location of the snapshot files and some configuration parameters, and produce a series of plots/GIFs/videos as a result. By default, some of these functions may produce a large number of images (but it can be configured to do less), and they may take a long time to run, especially if the function uses the `pgfplotsx` backend of [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl).

## PGFPlotsX backend

Some plotting and pipeline function make use of the PGFPlotsX backend, and as such, the command `pgfplotsx()` should be always called at least once per session before these functions (as it is done in `example/example.jl`). With time, and as some issues with GR are resolved, the functions will be hopefully migrated to the GR backend, making this caveat obsolete.

## Documentation

Each function is documented within the script, where a docstring explains the functionality, the arguments and the returns.

Refer to `example/example.jl` for how to use the functions. Note that it expects the simple file structure of this repo, namely:

    .
    ├── src
	│    ├── GADGETPlotting.jl 
	│    └── ...
    ├── example	  
    │    ├── test_data
    │    │    └── ...
    │    ├── example.jl
	│    └── ...

## Warnings

- Some functions are intended for the data generated by GADGET3, which is not a publicly available code.
- This script is written for personal use and may break at any moment. So, no guaranties are given.
