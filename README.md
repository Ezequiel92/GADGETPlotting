Julia module for creating plots, GIFs, and videos from the data produced by GAGET2/3/4 simulations.

There are many tools to plot/analyze the data generated by GADGET (you can see some in the [References](https://github.com/Ezequiel92/GADGETPlotting#-references) section), but this was written not only to plot and analyze simulations but as an exercise to learn [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and to understand in detail the output of GADGET.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Characteristics

- This only works with the alternative (binary data) output format of GADGET2/3/4 (option `SnapFormat = 2`).
- This is a script inside a module, not a package. Only five global constants and no data structures are defined.
- Two small testing data sets are provided in `example/example_data/`, one from an isolated simulation and the other from a cosmological one.
- The script `example/run_examples.jl` shows how to import the main module, gives examples for every function, and provides a sanity check, as it should run as is without errors.
- The dependencies are given by the `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files.

## üñ•Ô∏è Functions

There are four tiers of functions:

- Auxiliary functions (`src/auxiliary.jl`): These are only for internal use. All but `make_video` are pure functions that do soma data processing. Some of these are exported for testing purposes.
- Data acquisition functions (`src/data_acquisition.jl`): These are only for internal use. They take the location of the data files, apply some transformation (e.g. unit conversions) and return the data inside a familiar data structure.
- Plotting functions (`src/plotting.jl`): These are exported, but I do not recommend using them as is. If you insist in using them, read the [Plotting backends](https://github.com/Ezequiel92/GADGETPlotting#-plotting-backends) section below. These are pure functions that take data in the format outputted by the data acquisition functions and return plot objects. They do all the data processing necessary to create the plots, except unit conversions. They will plot using the units selected when the data acquisition functions were called.
- Pipeline functions (`src/pipelines.jl`): These are exported. These functions run a whole pipeline, from raw data to the final plot. They take the location of the snapshot files with some configuration parameters, and as a result, produce a series of plots/GIFs/videos. By default, some of these functions may generate a large number of images (but it can be configured to do less), and they may take a long time to run, especially if the function uses the `pgfplotsx` backend of [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl).

## üö® Plotting backends

The plotting functions use different backends, which are activated within each function. So, to save the figures after a plotting function call, you have to use `Base.invokelatest(savefig, figure, location)` instead of `savefig(figure, location)` (as it is done in `example/example_plotting.jl`). The pipeline functions do this internally, so you can call them directly with no extra caveats. 

## üìò Documentation

Each function is documented within the corresponding source file where a docstring explains the functionality, the arguments, and the returns.

Refer to `examples/` for how to use the functions. Note that the scripts there expect the simple file structure of this repo, namely:

    .

I make extensive use of [Ludwig Boess](https://github.com/LudwigBoess/) packages to read snapshots, manipulate units and apply kernels to GADGET data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- Some functions use data generated exclusively by GADGET3, which is not a publicly available code. See for example the documentation for the `sfr_txt_data` function.
- This script is written for personal use and may break at any moment. So, use it at your own risk.
